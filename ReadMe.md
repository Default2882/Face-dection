**Hello!**

This is a personal project made during when i was playing around with opencv and other libraries.

**How to use the tool**

place the images that you want to process into the image.zip file, and run the Face_detection.py python script.
It works by making a blank 50*50 canvas from the first face it detects(you can change the canvas size to save more faces).
