# Face detection project

## Dependencies:

- OpenCV
- Pillow
- Numpy
- Pyplot
- Matplotlib

## Installing dependencies:

```python
pip3 install numpy pillow opencv-python pytesseract matplotlib
```

## Behing the scenes: 

**Hello!** This is a personal project made during when i was playing around with opencv and other libraries.

## How to use the tool:

place the images that you want to process into the image.zip file, and run the Face_detection.py python script.
```python
python3 Face_detection.py
```

It works by making a blank 50*50 canvas from the first face it detects(you can change the canvas size to save more faces).
